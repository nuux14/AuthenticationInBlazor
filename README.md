An asp.net core blazor server with authentication and authorization (.NET 7). In this project we are using SQLite database

### Visual Studio Code (or any code editor)

1. Navigate to the `AuthenticationInBlazor` folder 
1. If you haven't installed the EF Core Command Line Interface (CLI), install it by following [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet). Choose the latest stable version (the project file currently ships with version 7.0.9).
1. This migration step has already been done but for reference this is what you'd have done: 

    ```text
   dotnet ef migrations add Initial
    ``` 

    or if you would want you could specify the DbContext option like this:


    ```text
   dotnet ef migrations add --context ApplicationDbContext Initial
   ```
   
    to set up the  database migrations (already done).
1. Run 

    ```text
   dotnet ef database update
   ``` 
    
    to create the AuthenticationInBlazor database.
1. Type 

   ```text
   dotnet run` or `dotnet watch
   ```
    
   to start the server. Navigate to the port specified.
  
> **Note**: the demo app is designed to show how to add authentication and authorization to an asp.net blazor server app.
